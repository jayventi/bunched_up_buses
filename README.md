# Bunched Up Bus Analysis MBTA

This data project attempts to locate  the occurrence of  'bunch ups' buses, a conditions where several buses, arrive immediately one after the other. 

Bunched buses is an indication that the bus system is congested and thrashing, becoming less efficient as it attempts to handle more traffic. his is characterized by unusually large groups of people waiting long times during rush hours. when eventually a bus arrives it takes a long time to load and may overflow. Ultimately a second nearly empty bus and sometimes a third bus will follow on immediately after the first bus. this condition causes a breakdown in the efficiency of the bus line since the second and third following buses are not evenly loaded.

here the attempt is to attempt to characterize this by looking at actual wait times for a first second and third bus from the standpoint of a single bus stop looking at buses traveling along each individual route over a one day

Here were looking at Boston MBTA data http://mbta-history.apptic.xyz and https://www.mbta.com/gtfs_archive/ data repositories.

the project was executed in google colab see the in-line comments for further description
