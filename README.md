# Bunched Up Bus Analysis Using MBTA Data

This project attempts to map the occurrence of 'bunch ups' buses, a condition where several buses, arrive immediately one after the other at a given bus stop.
<br /><br />
Bunched buses is an indication that the bus system is congested and thrashing, becoming less efficient as it attempts to handle more traffic. This is characterized by unusually large groups of people waiting long times during rush hours. When eventually a bus arrives it takes a unusually long time to load and may overflow. Ultimately a second nearly empty bus and sometimes a third bus will follow on immediately after the first bus, these latter buses being under utilized. This condition causes a breakdown in the efficiency of the bus line since buses are extremely on evenly loaded and large wait times occur between the sets of buses.
<br /><br />
Here we attempt to characterize the system breakdown by looking at actual wait times for a first second and third bus from the standpoint of a single bus stop looking at buses traveling along each individual route over a one day
